    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>One task that I've been working toward in my personal life is becoming a professional automotive car detailer. Some experience's that I've been having to make it here is while as a kid I would love doing the extra thing to make my family happy and washing their cars and making them look nice and comfortable. A couple of ways I'm working towards my goals are being able to promote my business socially in person and online as well as being able to do what I do while making clients happy. Some values that I would consider necessary is obviously equipment to work,  but as well as motivation and ways to keep yourself from being discipline and motivated to work. A short-term goal I have is to hopefully get a rep going and being to have a somewhat constant flow of clients, as well as being able to have a name on social media and some locals can recognize me. Character-traits I would like to be known for is hardworking, discipline, dedicated and to be known for doing a good job at what I do</p>
